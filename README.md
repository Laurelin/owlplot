# owlplot

framework-agnostic charting library (typescript).  
svg mvp with clean core + scene graph → easy integrations.

## vision

owlplot exists to make charts that are:
- simple to work with
- visually appealing by default
- designed to minimize bugs and surprises
- framework-agnostic at the core
- easy to extend with renderers, themes, and interactions

## current status

✅ core compute logic for line charts  
✅ deterministic scene graph + vitest snapshot tests  
🚧 no renderer yet (svg/canvas) — in progress  
🚧 integrations (react/vue) coming soon  
🚧 docs/examples expanding

## quickstart (dev)

clone + install:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Laurelin/owlplot
cd owlplot
npm install
